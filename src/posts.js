        description: `In attempt to take it easy, we spent the day hiking around Cusco and visiting an old Incan fortress called
        Sacsayhuaman (pronounced "Sexy Woman"... it was hard to take ourselves seriously when talking about it). It is the old 
        Incan capital build in 900 CE. It used to be massive and the rocks have been intricately fitted together without mortar. 
        Apparently they still don't quite know how they fitted these massive boulders together so seamlessly. Other than the 
        architectural phenomenon, it's also a beautiful park at the top of the many hills in Cusco.`,

        description: `Welcome to Lake Humantay! We were weenies and decided to sign up for only 1 day of the 4-5 day Salktantay trek 
        The elevation is about 4300 meters(?). All we know is the Humantay Peak which is the glacier above the lake is 17,956 ft, so needless
        to say, breathing was hard on this hike, but it was SO pretty. It was worth the lung strain and the burning glutes`,

        description: `We decided to finally take a city walk around Cusco and visiting churches/market etc. 
        San Francisco de Asis Church/Convent was a big hit for us because it was raining and they had catacombs, which
        turned out to be creepier than we expected. They are just rooms with arranged human skeletons and you have to stumble around
        the VERY dark room to switch on the lights. In one such case it appeared simply as a stone staircase into the darkness,
        which is basically the scary part of EVERY HORROR MOVIE EVER. Naturally Mike bounded in, but I escaped that basement of bones
        as fast as I could. No pics of that horrifying moment at the convent, but here's a pic of a city alpaca on our walk home.`,

        so basically we walk a block and have to stop to rest. We were feeling pretty pleased with
        ourselves until we saw a guy running at least an 8 min mile through the hills near our apartment.

        So far we've discovered that Cusco has seemingly more hills than San Francisco
        and their own brand of hairless dog.`,
